Archived code (2025-09-22)

This folder contains placeholders for older UI/entrypoint variants that were creating confusion. The running app now uses `app.main_step2` with UI in `app/ui/pages_step2.py`.

Archived modules (original files removed from app/ to declutter):
- app/main_enhanced.py
- app/main_modern.py
- app/main_step1.py
- app/ui/modern_pages.py
- app/ui/layout_improvements.py
- app/ui/pages_backup.py

Only lightweight stubs are stored here; logic is preserved in Git history once you commit.
